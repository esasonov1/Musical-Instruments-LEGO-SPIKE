# MUSICAL INSTRUMNETS LEGO SPIKE
Emma Sasonov, 8/1/2023


Purpose: A library to be used on the LEGO SPIKE Prime that allows kids to build instruments
         with LEGO SPIKE sensors that can play notes through MIDI on GarageBand using an iPad/iPhone.
         This library contains simple and easy to use functions that can be called to create fun
         and cool instruments!


*Note: There are several variations of ble_emma... this is because some include automatic port detection
      while others only work for previous SPIKE firmwares. Some of the latest updates dont work
      on a few of the librarys.

              
Instructions:
1. Load ble_advertising.py, ble_CBR.py, and ble_emma to your SPIKE Prime
2. Either use example code to create a music or use functions from my library by importing ble_emma
3. Run code (When you run your code, it should say â€œWaiting.....") 
4. Open up Garage Band
5. Select an Instrument (any instrument!)
      - Press the settings button on the top right of your screen (âš™)
      - Click Advanced 
      - Click Bluetooth MIDI Devices
      - Select the name that appears (should first say Not Connected and then change to Connected)
             - Feel free to change the name of the connection in your code!(8 char max)            
6. Plays some cool music! ðŸŽ¶ (make sure to use some LEGO SPIKE sensors in your build!)

Once up and running, try recording your music in GarageBand!

Good luck! :)
